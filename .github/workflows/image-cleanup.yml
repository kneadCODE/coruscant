# Docker Image Cleanup Automation for Coruscant Project
#
# This workflow automatically manages container image lifecycle in GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
# to prevent storage bloat and manage costs while maintaining recent versions for rollbacks.
#
# Cleanup Strategy:
# - Retention Policy: Keep 2 most recent versions of each image
# - Trigger: Weekly schedule (Sunday 3 AM UTC) + manual dispatch
# - Scope: All container packages in the repository
# - Safety: Preserves recent images for production rollbacks
#
# Architecture:
# - Two-stage job: First discovers all packages, then cleans each one
# - Matrix strategy for parallel cleanup of multiple packages
# - Uses GitHub's official package management actions
#
# Benefits:
# - Reduces storage costs in GitHub Container Registry
# - Maintains clean package registry while preserving rollback capability
# - Automated maintenance reduces manual overhead
