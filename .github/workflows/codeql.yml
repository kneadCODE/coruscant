# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for Coruscant Project
#
# This workflow performs CodeQL static analysis on Go code to identify
# security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
#
# Scan Coverage:
# - Security vulnerabilities in Go code
# - Common coding errors and anti-patterns  
# - Supply chain security analysis
#
# Architecture:
# - Reports findings to GitHub Security tab via SARIF
# - Runs on PR/push for fast feedback + weekly scheduled scans
# - Uses security-extended queries for comprehensive analysis
